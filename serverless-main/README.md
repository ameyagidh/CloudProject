# Serverless

This repository contains serverless functions built using AWS Lambda for various purposes. The functions are designed to handle specific tasks without the need to manage servers, making them highly scalable and cost-effective.

## Functions

1. **EmailSender**: This function sends emails using Amazon Simple Email Service (SES). It can be integrated into applications to send transactional emails, notifications, and alerts.

2. **DataProcessor**: The DataProcessor function processes incoming data streams from sources like Amazon Kinesis or Amazon S3. It performs real-time analysis, aggregation, or transformation of the data.

3. **ImageResizer**: This function automatically resizes images uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket. It ensures that images are optimized for different screen sizes and resolutions.

## Deployment

Each function can be deployed individually using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or infrastructure-as-code tools like AWS CloudFormation or AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM).

## Usage

To use these functions, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the function to AWS Lambda.
2. Configure any necessary event triggers or permissions.
3. Integrate the function into your application by invoking it via its AWS Lambda ARN.
